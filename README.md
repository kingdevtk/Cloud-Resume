Built a resume website from the ground up with a custom domain and HTTPs security; leveraged multiple AWS services (Route53, S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, APIGW, CloudFront, Certificate Manager) to deploy the site and trigger automatic updates to a visitor counter built into the page. Built a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline (now using Github Actions) for building, testing, and deployment.
