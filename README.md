## Cloud Resume Challenge
### This is the FE code (HTML & CSS) for my resume website built to complete the AWS cloud resume challenge by Forrest Brazeal (https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/). This repo also contains the necessary files to run my CI/CD pipeline (I used AWS Codepipeline) that automatically updates the site based on any changes made to the HTML or CSS file here in this repo.
